# Frontend Changes Summary

## Overview
No direct frontend changes were made in this implementation. The enhancements were focused on the backend testing infrastructure to support the RAG system's API endpoints.

## Backend Testing Infrastructure Enhancements

### Files Modified/Created:

1. **pyproject.toml** (modified)
   - Added `httpx>=0.27.0` dependency for API testing
   - Added comprehensive pytest configuration with test markers
   - Configured test paths and naming conventions

2. **backend/tests/conftest.py** (enhanced)
   - Added API testing fixtures including `test_app`, `api_client`, and `mock_rag_for_api`
   - Created inline FastAPI test application to avoid import issues with static files
   - Added sample data fixtures for API request/response testing

3. **backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py** (created)
   - Comprehensive API endpoint tests covering all FastAPI routes
   - Tests for `/api/query`, `/api/courses`, `/api/new-chat`, and root endpoints
   - Request validation, response model validation, error handling, and integration tests
   - 22 API-specific tests with proper mocking and assertions

## Impact on Frontend
While no frontend code was directly modified, these testing enhancements provide:

- **API Reliability**: Comprehensive testing ensures the frontend can rely on stable API responses
- **Response Validation**: Tests verify that API responses match expected schemas the frontend depends on
- **Error Handling**: Tests ensure proper error responses that the frontend can handle gracefully
- **Integration Safety**: Full workflow tests protect against breaking changes that could affect frontend functionality

## Test Coverage
- 76 total tests (54 existing + 22 new API tests)
- API tests can be run separately using: `uv run pytest -m api`
- All tests passing, ensuring robust backend support for frontend operations

## Future Frontend Integration
The enhanced testing framework provides a solid foundation for:
- Frontend API integration testing
- Mock API responses for frontend development
- Reliable backend behavior verification
- Safe deployment of frontend changes
