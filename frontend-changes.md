# Frontend Changes - Dark/Light Theme Toggle Feature

## Overview
Added a dark/light theme toggle feature that allows users to switch between themes with a smooth transition animation. The theme preference is persisted in localStorage.

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/index.html`
- **Added theme toggle button** in the top-right corner with sun and moon SVG icons
- Button includes proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`)
- Positioned as the first child of the `.container` div

### 2. `frontend/style.css`
- **Added light theme CSS variables** with appropriate color scheme for good contrast
- **Added theme toggle button styling** with:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Circular design with hover/focus/active states
  - Icon rotation animations when switching themes
  - Responsive sizing for mobile devices
- **Added smooth transitions** (0.3s ease) to major UI elements:
  - Body background and text color
  - Main content areas
  - Sidebar and chat container backgrounds
  - All theme-dependent elements
- **Enhanced mobile responsiveness** with smaller button size on mobile

### 3. `frontend/script.js`
- **Added theme toggle functionality**:
  - `initializeTheme()` - Loads saved theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()` - Switches between light and dark themes
  - `applyTheme()` - Applies theme by setting/removing `data-theme` attribute
- **Added event listeners**:
  - Click handler for theme toggle button
  - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+T / Cmd+Shift+T) for accessibility
- **Added theme persistence** using localStorage

## Theme Design Details

### Dark Theme (Default)
- Background: Deep slate colors (#0f172a, #1e293b)
- Text: Light colors (#f1f5f9, #94a3b8)
- Primary: Blue (#2563eb)
- Shadows: Dark with higher opacity

### Light Theme
- Background: White and light grays (#ffffff, #f8fafc)
- Text: Dark colors (#1e293b, #64748b)
- Primary: Same blue (#2563eb) for consistency
- Shadows: Light with lower opacity

## User Experience Features
1. **Smooth transitions**: 0.3s ease animations between theme switches
2. **Icon animations**: Sun/moon icons rotate and fade when toggling
3. **Theme persistence**: User's choice is saved and restored on page reload
4. **Accessibility**: 
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard shortcut support
   - Focus indicators
   - High contrast ratios in both themes
5. **Responsive design**: Button resizes appropriately on mobile devices

## Technical Implementation
- Uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for efficient theme switching
- Theme applied via `data-theme="light"` attribute on body element
- Dark theme is default (no attribute needed)
- Smooth transitions applied to all color-dependent properties
- LocalStorage integration for theme persistence

## Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties
- Fallback to dark theme if localStorage is unavailable
- SVG icons supported in all modern browsers
