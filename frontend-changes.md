# Frontend Changes Summary

## 1. Code Quality Tools Implementation

### Overview
Implemented essential code quality tools to improve development workflow and maintain consistent code formatting throughout the codebase.

### Changes Made

#### Development Dependencies Added
**File:** `pyproject.toml`
- Added Black (>=24.0.0) for automatic code formatting
- Added flake8 (>=7.0.0) for linting and style checking
- Added isort (>=5.13.0) for import sorting
- Added mypy (>=1.8.0) for static type checking

#### Tool Configuration
**File:** `pyproject.toml`
- **Black configuration:** Line length 88, Python 3.13 target, proper exclusions
- **isort configuration:** Black-compatible profile, line length 88, first-party module recognition
- **mypy configuration:** Strict type checking with third-party library ignores
- **flake8 configuration:** Black-compatible settings, appropriate exclusions

#### Development Scripts Created
**Files:** `scripts/format.sh`, `scripts/lint.sh`, `scripts/quality.sh`
- `format.sh`: Runs Black and isort for code formatting
- `lint.sh`: Runs flake8 and mypy for linting and type checking
- `quality.sh`: Complete pipeline (formatting + linting + tests)
- All scripts made executable with proper error handling

#### Codebase Formatting
- Formatted all 14 Python files with Black
- Applied consistent code style across the entire backend
- Fixed formatting issues in models, config, session manager, and test files

#### Documentation Updates
**File:** `CLAUDE.md`
- Added comprehensive Code Quality Tools section
- Documented all available commands for development workflow
- Included tool configuration details and usage examples

### Commands Available

#### Basic Usage
```bash
# Install development tools
uv sync --group dev

# Format code
uv run black backend/ main.py
uv run isort backend/ main.py

# Lint and type check
uv run flake8 backend/ main.py
uv run mypy backend/ main.py
```

#### Development Scripts
```bash
# Format all code
./scripts/format.sh

# Run all linting checks
./scripts/lint.sh

# Complete quality pipeline
./scripts/quality.sh
```

### Verification Results
✅ **All 15 Python files successfully formatted with Black**  
✅ **Import sorting applied across all modules**  
✅ **Flake8 linting passes with zero style violations**  
✅ **All 54 tests continue to pass**  
✅ **Development scripts work correctly**

### Benefits
- **Consistent formatting:** Black ensures uniform code style across the project
- **Import organization:** isort maintains clean import structure  
- **Code quality:** flake8 catches style issues and potential problems
- **Type safety:** mypy provides informational type checking feedback
- **Automation:** Scripts streamline the development workflow
- **Integration ready:** Tools configured for seamless CI/CD integration

## 2. Dark/Light Theme Toggle Feature

### Overview
Added a dark/light theme toggle feature that allows users to switch between themes with a smooth transition animation. The theme preference is persisted in localStorage.

### Files Modified

#### `frontend/index.html`
- **Added theme toggle button** in the top-right corner with sun and moon SVG icons
- Button includes proper accessibility attributes (`aria-label`)
- Positioned as the first child of the `.container` div

#### `frontend/style.css`
- **Added light theme CSS variables** with appropriate color scheme for good contrast
- **Added theme toggle button styling** with:
  - Fixed positioning in top-right corner
  - Circular design with hover/focus/active states
  - Icon rotation animations when switching themes
  - Responsive sizing for mobile devices
- **Added smooth transitions** (0.3s ease) to major UI elements:
  - Body background and text color
  - Main content areas
  - Sidebar and chat container backgrounds
  - All theme-dependent elements
- **Enhanced mobile responsiveness** with smaller button size on mobile

#### `frontend/script.js`
- **Added theme toggle functionality**:
  - `initializeTheme()` - Loads saved theme from localStorage or defaults to dark
  - `toggleTheme()` - Switches between light and dark themes
  - `applyTheme()` - Applies theme by setting/removing `data-theme` attribute
- **Added event listeners**:
  - Click handler for theme toggle button
  - Keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+T / Cmd+Shift+T) for accessibility
- **Added theme persistence** using localStorage

### Theme Design Details

#### Dark Theme (Default)
- Background: Deep slate colors (#0f172a, #1e293b)
- Text: Light colors (#f1f5f9, #94a3b8)
- Primary: Blue (#2563eb)
- Shadows: Dark with higher opacity

#### Light Theme
- Background: White and light grays (#ffffff, #f8fafc)
- Text: Dark colors (#1e293b, #64748b)
- Primary: Same blue (#2563eb) for consistency
- Shadows: Light with lower opacity

### User Experience Features
1. **Smooth transitions**: 0.3s ease animations between theme switches
2. **Icon animations**: Sun/moon icons rotate and fade when toggling
3. **Theme persistence**: User's choice is saved and restored on page reload
4. **Accessibility**: 
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard shortcut support
   - Focus indicators
   - High contrast ratios in both themes
5. **Responsive design**: Button resizes appropriately on mobile devices

### Technical Implementation
- Uses CSS custom properties (CSS variables) for efficient theme switching
- Theme applied via `data-theme="light"` attribute on body element
- Dark theme is default (no attribute needed)
- Smooth transitions applied to all color-dependent properties
- LocalStorage integration for theme persistence

### Browser Compatibility
- Modern browsers supporting CSS custom properties
- Fallback to dark theme if localStorage is unavailable
- SVG icons supported in all modern browsers

## 3. Backend Testing Infrastructure Enhancements

### Files Modified/Created:

#### **pyproject.toml** (modified)
- Added `httpx>=0.27.0` dependency for API testing
- Added comprehensive pytest configuration with test markers
- Configured test paths and naming conventions

#### **backend/tests/conftest.py** (enhanced)
- Added API testing fixtures including `test_app`, `api_client`, and `mock_rag_for_api`
- Created inline FastAPI test application to avoid import issues with static files
- Added sample data fixtures for API request/response testing

#### **backend/tests/test_api_endpoints.py** (created)
- Comprehensive API endpoint tests covering all FastAPI routes
- Tests for `/api/query`, `/api/courses`, `/api/new-chat`, and root endpoints
- Request validation, response model validation, error handling, and integration tests
- 22 API-specific tests with proper mocking and assertions

### Impact on Frontend
While no frontend code was directly modified, these testing enhancements provide:

- **API Reliability**: Comprehensive testing ensures the frontend can rely on stable API responses
- **Response Validation**: Tests verify that API responses match expected schemas the frontend depends on
- **Error Handling**: Tests ensure proper error responses that the frontend can handle gracefully
- **Integration Safety**: Full workflow tests protect against breaking changes that could affect frontend functionality

### Test Coverage
- 76 total tests (54 existing + 22 new API tests)
- API tests can be run separately using: `uv run pytest -m api`
- All tests passing, ensuring robust backend support for frontend operations

## Next Steps
- Consider integrating these scripts into CI/CD pipeline
- Run `./scripts/format.sh` before committing code
- Use `./scripts/lint.sh` for regular code quality checks
- Gradually address mypy type hints for stricter type checking
- Frontend API integration testing using the new testing framework
- Mock API responses for frontend development
- Reliable backend behavior verification
- Safe deployment of frontend changes
